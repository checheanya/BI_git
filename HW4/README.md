> December 2022, Bioinformatics Institute

This repo contains information on the functional analysis of the *Ramazzottius varieornatus* genome assembly. The aim of the study was to identify which genes could be responsible for the radiation resistance in Tardigrades.

In this repo you can find:
* task statement 
* final report
* lab notebook with details of all steps we carried out (*.ipynb*)
* annotation data with AUGUSTUS
* output data for BLASTP and DIAMOND runs
