## Project #3. “E.coli outbreak investigation”. De novo assembly

> Anna Chechenina, German 

> December 2022, Bioinformatics Institute

This repo contains information on the genome assembly problem for the Escherichia coli outbreak in 2011. Pipeline included the reads quallity analysis, genome assembly and its quallity examination, assembly annotation. After the contigs were sucessfuly assembled we perfoormed the search for the closest relative strain and identified the main changes that could led to the increased pathogeniety.

In this repo you can find:
* task statement 
* final report
* lab notebook with details of all steps we carried out
* raw data with reads where there are several files:
  - SRR292678 - paired end, insert size 470 bp (forward reads, reverse reads, 400 Mb each)
  - SRR292862 – mate pair, insert size 2 kb, (forward reads, reverse reads, 200 Mb each)
  - SRR292770 – mate pair, insert size 6 kb, (forward reads, reverse reads, 200 Mb each)

* folders with the output data for different programs, for the detailed information consult lab report and notebook!
